This repo contains KiCAD design files for my hobby discrete-logic CPU, Vera.

You can find the main repo here: https://github.com/bcrist/vera

This repo is kept separately because KiCAD files tend to get very large, and I want to be able to ensure that the main repo doesn't get bloated with them.  The main repo instead has this repo as a shallow submodule.  Yes, I could have just used LFS instead, but I'd rather it be completely separate.
